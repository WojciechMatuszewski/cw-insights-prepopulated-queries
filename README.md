Have you ever opened the "Queries" tab in the _AWS CloudWatch Insights_ console?
While we can save existing queries, would it not be nice to have them defined as code?

This repo contains two sample applications. One deployed using _AWS CDK_ one using _AWS SAM_.
Both of them show you how to declare _AWS CloudWatch Insights_ queries as code.

For deployment instructions, refer to the `README.md` in a given directory.
